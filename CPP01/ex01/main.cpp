//LIFO Order (Last In, First Out): In C++, objects stored in a dynamically allocated array are destroyed in reverse order of their creation when the array is deleted.
//This is because the destructor for the array needs to ensure that each object's destructor is called, starting from the last element to prevent potential issues like dependency-related errors or memory corruption.
